Surah Al-Fatihah (The Opening) - Quran 1:1-7
In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,
the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help.
Guide us along the Straight Path,
the path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.

Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - Quran 2:255 - Ayat al-Kursi
Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence.
Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.
Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?
He knows what is before them and what will be after them,
and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills.
His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth,
and their preservation tires Him not.
And He is the Most High, the Most Great.

Surah Al-Ikhlas (Sincerity) - Quran 112:1-4

Allah, the Eternal Refuge.
He neither begets nor is born.
Nor is there to Him any equivalent."
